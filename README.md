# 🔧  Configs for my Debian system
This repository contains my lightweight configurations for Zsh, Kitty, Emacs, i3, and other tools I use daily. They are tailored for low-level programming and optimized to run smoothly even on older machines. It’s a minimal setup, free from heavy frameworks or flashy themes like Oh My Zsh or Doom, designed to keep development fast, clean, and efficient.

## 📥 Installation
The repository includes an `install.sh` script that automates the entire setup process. To run it:
```
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
> [!Important]
> Note that `sudo` is required because the script installs packages on your system.

## ⚙️ Utilities
The installation script also sets up a collection of lightweight, essential utilities to enhance productivity and keep the system minimal:
- `bat` a modern cat replacement with syntax highlighting
- `Emacs` a powerful keyboard‑driven text editor
- `eza` a Rust-based ls replacement with icons
- `flameshot` screenshot tool
- `htop` process and resource monitor
- `ImageMagick` versatile image editor and converter
- `Kitty` fast, GPU-based terminal emulator
- `MuPDF` lightweight PDF viewer
- `ripgrep` a fast grep replacement with search highlitghting
- `Thunar` simple and efficient file manager
- `Vim` light-weight text editor, perfect for quick tasks
- `Zen` minimal web browser

## 📐 i3

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="rofi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1630c733-3902-4c43-905c-43c7237db83d" /> <br/> <br/>

Since i3 is based on X11, the application launcher is Rofi. Press Super + Space to open it, navigate with the arrow keys or type the name of an app to search, and press Enter to launch your selection.

The top bar is powered by Polybar. On the left, it displays RAM usage, CPU usage, and battery status (when charging, the label changes from `BAT` to `BAT+`). In the center, you’ll find the active workspaces, while on the right it shows Wi-Fi status, current date, and the time.

## ⌨️ Keybinds

In window managers like i3, keybindings are crucial and can make the mouse almost unnecessary. Here are the ones I’ve configured on my system to streamline and accelerate my development workflow.

| Keybind | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Super + B | Start browser (Zen) |
| Super + Enter | Launch terminal (kitty) |
| Super + Space | Launch Rofi |
| Super + Ctrl + l | Lock screen (i3lock) |
| Super + e | Start Emacs |
| Super + f | Start  file manager (Thunar) |
| Super + v | Launch audio mixer |
| Super + h | Show keybindings help |
| Super + w | Launch Wallpaper Menu |
| Super + print | Take a screenshot |
| Super + [1-9, 0] | Switch to workspace 1-10 |
| Super + Shift + [1-9, 0] | Move current window to workspace 1-10 |
| Super + q | Quit window |
| Super + Shift + q | Quit i3 |
| Super + insert | Volume up |
| Super + delete | Volume down |
| Super + Alt + f | Toggle fullscreen |

Press Super + h to list all of the keybinds

## 🖼️ Wallpapers

To set a new wallpaper, copy it into the `.config/wallpapers` folder, press Super + w, and select it from the wallpaper menu. The chosen wallpaper will be saved and set as the default, so you won’t need to change it each time you log in.

## 💻 Zsh

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="terminal" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58d7d4db-1996-43a6-976b-5a14a34ddda0" /> <br/> <br/>

My prompt is very simple: `TIME CURRENT_DIRECTORY GIT_BRANCH`. I don’t use frameworks like Oh My Zsh or unusual plugins. Instead, I’ve defined aliases to help with commands I can’t always remember, frequently used long commands, and others that make my terminal cleaner and more user-friendly.

| Alias | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `..` | Change to the parent directory |
| `cat` | Maps to `batcat`, a `cat` replacement with syntax highlighting |
| `catp` | Provides the classic `cat` command |
| `clearhist` | Clears zsh history |
| `cyclic` | Prints a specified number of "A" to stdout |
| `github` | Connects to GitHub automatically using an SSH key |
| `grep` | An alias for ripgrep, a fast grep replacement |
| `imgshow` | Displays an image directly in Kitty |
| `ls` | Maps to `eza`, a Rust-based alternative to `ls` with icons |
| `la` | Lists all files in the directory |
| `ll` | Lists files with additional information |
| `lt` | Displays the current directory in a tree-like output |
| `pwncheck` | Basic PWN controls like stack canaries and non‑exec stack |

## 📘 Emacs

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="emacs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbce0030-62f7-4287-94cb-9aadc55d3b5f" /> <br/> <br/>

Emacs is already set up for different programming languages, such as C/C++, Go, and Rust. The theme I use is custom, since I couldn’t find one that matched my system’s colors. I use the classic Emacs keybindings, but I’ve also configured some of my own because I find them easier to use.

| Keybind | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `C-z` | Undo |
| `C-l` | Mark the whole line |
| `M-<up>` | Move the line up |
| `M-<down>` | Move the line down |
| `M-x` | Start smex |

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### Emacs
- If irony says it can't contact server, run `M-x irony-server-install`
- If irony has "couldn't find irony.el" issue, follow <a href="https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode/issues/592">this guide</a>
- To install go, just type `sudo apt install gopls` in your terminal
